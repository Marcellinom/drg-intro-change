## What it does
Changes your Deep Rock Galactic's intro video
## How it works
1. it searches for steam paths on your registry (for now, windows system only)
2. find a downloaded DRG path from those steam paths
3. renames old intro video (so you don't lose it)
4. asks you for a video link to download
5. downloads it and add it as the new intro
## How can it works?
DRG's intro is just an mp4 lol, you can just change it. This just automates it so you don't have to skim for installed DRG folder
